# A-star-algorithm-visualization

This program lets user set a starting point, an ending point and a barrier. Then after pressing spacebar it will find and draw the shortest path between the two points 
using A* algorithm.

What I have mainly learned while making this project are:
- object oriented programming
- A* algorithm working principle and python implementation
- how to use pygame module
